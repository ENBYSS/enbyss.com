            Wanna know when I'm doing things? This page will show all upcoming things that I've remembered to put in - 
            including <i>streams</i> and <i>videos</i>. In the future I might add more things, but that probably doesn't
            make sense does it...
        </PageLink>

        <PageLink href="/tools" title="Tools">
            Well I've created a site - so evidently programming is my realm. As you all know, lots of problems exist out there -
            so why not use this skill to make solutions of <i>varying</i> quality? Behold - my tools!
        </PageLink>

        <PageLink href="/babel" title="Babel">
            I tend to write a lot - reviews, announcements, articles - the sorts. If you've ever seen me in motion, you know
            that I talk for <i>way too long</i> - so why not create a space for all my thoughts? Enter Babel, and see all the garbage
            I thought to immortalize.
        </PageLink>

        <PageLink href="/support" title="Support">
            Some people think that what I do is cool <i>(for some reason)</i> - so I decided to craft a page in celebration.
            Wanna see a bunch of my metrics - like subscribers and patrons? This is the place for you! Here's the place where I
            commemorate everyone who supports me <div class="i-ph:smiley-fill"/>
        </PageLink>

        <PageLink href="/history" title="History">
            I've done a lot of streams, and you might wanna know whether I've done a certain game! Well, check out the <b>History</b>
            to know more! Also comes with information about where series are at - like if they're <i>suspended</i> or not. In the future
            I want to include videos as well :)
        </PageLink>

        <PageLink href="/fortune" title="Fortune">
            Lots of suggestions and potential streams come by my head, and if you'd like to see my current stance on a game/idea, come
            over here! If something isn't mentioned it's likely because I haven't given it much thought, or I don't know about it.
