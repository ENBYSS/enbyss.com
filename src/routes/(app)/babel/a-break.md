Heya. I've been taking breaks quite frequently lately so I wanted to write a full post on why I'm taking this one in order to elaborate further on things.

I've been feeling burnt out for quite a while now, and to be honest, the breaks haven't really been doing much. The **reasoning** is basically that during said breaks, I'd constantly think about needing to upload a video. The end of the break would be looming and I'd focus on it, leaving me worried about having stuff ready instead of just... trying to relax.

Let's be blunt - I have anxiety and ADHD. Editing comes really hard to me, and what editing I do also comes with a streak of worrying about whether I made something of worth. Sometimes, I'd work on something and feel **terrible** when it's done, because it'd feel like I just dumped garbage on my channel. It's not because of numbers - they don't affect me much anymore and as can be seen from my Yakuza "movie" series - I evidently don't care much about metrics.

But for those who come here and enjoy what I do, I want to present something good. I don't want to half-ass things, so that people can get some enjoyment out of my content instead of seeing someone they'd like turn into garbage. That **fear** makes resting hard, because there's a sense of guilt in taking that break. 

Some time ago, I took a break to rethink about my approach on numbers. That led me to an epiphany that I simply didn't need to care about them. Since then, I've been able to stream without any exhaustion or burnout - infact streaming can even be kind of refreshing for me. Now I believe it's time for me to rethink my approach on **editing.**

I'm taking a break from making videos - this break doesn't have a specific endpoint but I'm hoping it doesn't extend beyond **3 weeks.** If I need more, then I'll take more and probably inform if need be. However, I think that when I do come back some things may change.

For example, I may not have a schedule anymore. Instead, I might just upload things erratically. Sure, this is an algorithmic death sentence and can lead to confusion for viewers, but like I said - I don't care about numbers and metrics. However, I do want to try and mitigate the confusion whenever possible. My **current** plan is to add a page on my site that would list upcoming videos - their date and title.

I'm proud of having edited so many things in these past few years, and I've even finished Ruina which was a personal milestone of mine. I really don't want to stop editing and creating things, even if the process is hard. However, I need to approach editing differently - focusing on my needs and wants rather than the intense pressure of what is desired of me.

This doesn't mean I'll completely disregard requests mind you - on my **Risk of Rain 2** video people told me to keep playing it, and I did. It led to further streaming of the game infact, and I have more videos planned for it. However, rather than capitulating for the sake of numbers and pleasing, I want to capitulate simply because _I want to do it,_ like for **Risk of Rain 2** wherein I accepted the requests simply because I had a personal desire to give it another shot.

**ENBYSS** is not for numbers, for metrics, for goals or what have you. **ENBYSS** is for what we want, when we want, and how we want. My home where I get to have a say in things. A place where I can indulge in hobbies and showcase myself to the world. My editing for the past few months has been driven by a fear and stress to perform and deliver. It's time to change that, and make my videos once again driven by _passion_, _interest_, and _excitement_.

If you read this far, I thank you. It's a long message but I wanted to broadcast my thoughts and provide reasoning behind them so people can understand where I'm coming from with this.

Hope to see you soon,

**ENBYSS.**

### Some clarification

Yes, the Everhood and Yakuza Kiwami series are on hold until I come back. Once I do, they'll likely be what I upload first. Emphasis on _likely_ however.
