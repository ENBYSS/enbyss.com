This is a quick announcement because I just remembered that I actually have a place to make posts on! I already made an announcement on Youtube and Twitter but for those who follow this site only _(which like, I'm sure everyone forgot I had one at this point lmao)_, I've added a new perk for Patrons!

**Patrons will now get videos early!** This means that whenever I upload a video, Patrons will be able to see it immediately - whereas alternatively it would be schedule based.

Reasoning for this is to provide an additional incentive to become a Patron, while it also doesn't lock out non-Patrons from content.
